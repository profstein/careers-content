Careers in the Creative Arts - Content
===============

These files contain the content for a class project. The project is to create a web site for a fictitous event named Careers in the Creative Arts at the Borough of Manhattan Community College. 

While the event is not real, the speakers are and so is the college. 


## Using the Content
Each folder contains the content for a page. There are two files in each folder. One has the content and ends in -content.txt and the other has some instructions for the page and ends in instructions.md. For the Speakers page there is also a folder with images of the speakers.

Make sure to read through the instructions.

None of the content is marked up with HTML. It will be up to you to convert the files to HTML and then add your CSS.

The content files are just the text for the site. The folders roughly represent the pages on the site. **Do not** recreate the folder structure in this repository when you are creating your site. Instead start with making a page for each folder like:

* Home
* Schedule
* Sessions
* Speakers
* About
* Videos

You are going to be able to modify this a bit if you like but the overall content will need to remain.

##Creating Your Repository

Because the folder structure of this repository won't be the same as for your project I suggest NOT forking this but instead using the content to make a repository of your own. One option is to 

1. Use the **Download Zip** link and download the files from here to a local computer. Unzip the files and keep as a reference.
2. Create a blank repository on GitHub.com
2. Clone the repo to your local computer (or c9.io)
3. Make blank HTML5 files in the main folder for each of the pages: index.html, about.html, schedule.html, sessions.html, speakers.html, videos.html (you can have different names if you like but keep index.html for the home).
4. Then copy and paste the content from the -content.txt files into these new blank files
5. Add your markup to the content.
6. Copy the image files from the Speakers > Images folder to your site's images folder.
7. Add blank folders for css, sass (we will get to that later), images, and optionally js


Your project should now have a typical web structure with a main folder and then folders for css, images, js etc.

### Alternative Method
Do it similar to above but at first only create a page for index.html. Once you get this page worked out and the header and footer how you like them then you can copy this page and replace the inner content with the correct content for the page. Some people like this method because it prevents them having to copy and paste the header and footer from page to page once they get it how they want it.
